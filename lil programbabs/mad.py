print "As ",a," Shepard lay "b" on the floor of the Citadel's main control room, suddenly the floor beneath began "c" towards a "d" light." 
print "In the center of a wide arena, a voice called out to Shepard : ' "e" up '"
print"Shepard stood to see a "f" "g" "g" "
print"I am the "h". You are the first organic to ever "i" me."
print"'I have to stop the Reapers', said Shepard. 'Can you help me?'"
print"The Reapers are my "j".',, replied the "k" 'I made them because synthetics will always "l" organics. The Reapers act every "m", 000 years to prevent this.'"
print"'Not anymore - we "n" in the "o". Your plan has failed, "p".'"
print "'So it has. The "q" has made three options available. You must choose one of them.'" 
print "What are my options?"
print "The "r" explained: You can "s" the Reapers, "t" the Reapers or "u" everyone into a new lifeform. But no matter what you choose, the mass relays will "v" and you will "w"" 
print "And if I don't choose to do any of that?" 
print "Then the cycle will continue and nothing will change." 
print "Shepard "x" long and hard and then made a "y" decision that would change the galaxy forever. As Shepard moved to activate the option, a final thought went through their head: 'It's worth the choice. No matter what happens to me, my friends will all be "z" and the Reaper cycle will be over.'"
